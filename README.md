## Intro
This project showcases several simple C++ implementations of the GameOfLife using parallel programming.
The following alternatives are provided:
- [x] Simple sequential version.
- [x] Simple multithreaded version using std::thread.
- [x] Improved multithreaded version exploting vectorization.
- [ ] Multithreaded version utilizing bitwise operations.
- [ ] FastFlow version.
- [ ] versiont targeting Intel's Mic architecture.

## Usage
**WARNING**: Makefile's rule *intel* requires the usuage of Intel's proprietary compiler `icpc` and vectorization support.
